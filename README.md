## Running

  1. You should have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed for best results
    - If so, ensure you either run `nix-shell` at the top of the repo
  2. Otherwise, this is a BASH repo, Mac users and other ZSH-adherents are welcome to install a recent copy of BASH (>=4)
    - Once you do have BASH, you can run ./answer.bash to avoid the Nix-based shebangs

## Guidances

  - Humour is subjective
  - If my BASH looks cleaner than you're used to, don't be surprised
    - Bash is a [super language](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28693737/is-bash-a-programming-language)!, so don't @ me about it ðŸ˜‰
